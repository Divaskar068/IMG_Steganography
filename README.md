# IMG_Steganography
Cryptography Project

The above Files are attempts on creating a Image steganography 
AIM:
To build a GUI which has options to encrypt/decrypt or to hide some info in a image 
there should be buttons for opening an image and options to induce some noise in the image so that it cant be identified

steps:
open a image -> write some content on the right -> encroyt using an AES key from the file given -> hide the data -> hidden.png should be downloaded with the data
open hidden.png -> show data -> decrypt -> should display the exact data.

imagest.py is the latest working code (noise part is not working)
