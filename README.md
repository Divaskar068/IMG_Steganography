# IMG_Steganography
Cryptography Project

The above Files are attempts on creating a Image steganography 
# AIM:
To build a GUI which has options to encrypt/decrypt or to hide some info in a image 
there should be buttons for opening an image and options to encrypt, decrypt and induce some noise in the image.
The end result should be the data recieved on the other end.

# Steps:
open a image -> click encryption -> Write your data and input AES key -> Copy the encryption and past on blank side of Main interface -> Click hide data -> hidden.png {should be downloaded with the data}

Close and Open Application again:-    

open hidden.png -> Click show data -> click decryption -> copy past the encryption and key -> should display the exact data.

# INFO:
encryption_key.txt - has the template for the 256 bit AES key
imagest.py is the latest working code (noise part is not working)

# OUTPUTS:
